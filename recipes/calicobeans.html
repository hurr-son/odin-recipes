        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Calico Beans</strong> (Also known as <strong>Cowboy Beans</strong>) 
        is a bean dish popular in the southwestern United States. The dish
        consists of pinto beans and ground beef in a sweet and tangy sauce.
        Other types of meat can be used. The flavor is similar to baked beans but 
        with a southwestern twist. The dish includes canned beans, ketchup,
        and sometimes barbecue sauce. I like mine with bacon a little bit of 
        brown sugar.</p>
